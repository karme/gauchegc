Using wiimote with gauche on linux via bluetooth using cwiid.

Notes:

* c-wrapper can't parse the bluetooth headers anymore
  as workaround a parsable subset is used
  As safeguard to make sure the headers match the complete versions are
  used in the header filename.
  If you have a different version either provide your own version or
  make sure the declarations match.
  
Todos:

* merge balanceboard and wiimote directory
