        Introduction to Gauche Garbage Collection Project.

Gauche Garbage Collection (ggc) is a collection of programs for 
Gauche. We collect programs which are considered as ``garbage grade'',
i.e., poor quality or rarely useful programs for most people other 
than the author him/herself.  One of the motivations to distribute such 
programs is to encourage Gauche users to share their programs to Gauche 
comminuty even though he/she would think his/her code do not have enough 
quality to publish.  Share ideas!
