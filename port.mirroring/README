open-mirroring-input has been rewritten by the use of gauche.vport,
which appeared Gauche 0.8.2 or 0.8.3.

One day not so long time ago, I noticed the following when I was browsing
Gauche reference manual, on section 6.18.6 ``Procedural ports'', saying,

>  These procedures are deprecated and will be replaced by more general 
>  procedural APIs. 

It hit me, and tickling me into a desire to write something with the
use of them before they go away....

As the result MIRRORING-INPUT was born.  I never expected I could write
something usefull out of this kind of motivation, but I think this is
usefull, expecially when you are debugging something like lexer,
MIRRORING-INPUT will show you how much of input file has been read.

Anyway, it is possible that this implementation of MIRROING-INPUT
will not work with Gauche newer than version 0.8.

So, enjoy..... for now :-)
