Gplt.app                --  MacOSX application
Makefile                --  Recipe
README                  --  This file
comm_plot_glut*         --  helper shell script for MacOSX
example.scm		--  draw recursive patterns.
gnuplot.scm		--  Gauche module
gnuplot_x11s.diff       --  Patch for gplt_x11.c relative to gnuplot-3.7.
                            Although gnuplot.scm will work fine with a
                            standard gnuplot_x11, this patch enables you
                            to see drawings in real time. (It's fun)
pict-core.scm           --  stuff from SICP (used in example.scm)
plot_glut.c		--  Drawing engine written with GLUT (for MacOSX).
                            Executable is to be installed in your local 
                            binary directory.
